A version control system is useful as everychange you make in the code you have the ability to roll back to original code if it goes wrong, you also can also keep a track of who changes the code and what changes they make. As a big company a VCS is useful as you could have 10-20 people working on a deployment and to reduce time spent going through what you have all done in long unecessary meetings you have the chance to see what code changes they made and who made it so you can have a quick call if you need help understanding what they did. As an Individual you could create something that works and start adding in little sections to improve the system from your point of view and overtime you realise the customer doesn't want any of it and they want it removed, so instead of deleting heaps and heaps of code you can just roll back to before you started adding little sections that you thought were good for the system. Within a version control system it is beneficial for an individual or company as it helps keep track of tasks and requirements for the system needed from the customer. It is nearly impossible for everyone to just keep in mind and remember at the top of their heads what is needed, having a version control system gives you the ability to clone repositories and files so you can have multiple documents containing working code incase the system dies or loses all of their code. A VCS can be useful in the sense that you can alter and write a new piece of code for the software and have some people check your work so you don't implement a faulty code that could destroy the software. The benefits to a VCS when developing software as either an individual or as a team is major as it makes working on a piece of software safer, less time consuming and more efficient for building the piece of software. During the implementation period there are many benefits to a VCS. Including maintenance where you might get a load of bugs and errors within the first week of opening this software and its necessary to keep a track of a load of changes. With all of these tasks and bugs and all of these people working on the same project it is beneficial to have a VCS so you can see if your code might overlap theirs or you might want to roll back to when a piece of code wasn't implemented
